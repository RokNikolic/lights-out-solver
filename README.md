### Resources

- This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fHkKcy0x_U "Solving the 'Lights Out' Problem") explains this
puzzle very well which helped me with coding the solver.
- And [this page](https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/lomath.htm "The Mathematics of Lights Out") was also very helpful.
